### Legal Risks and Why You Should Use a VPN

Streaming copyrighted content from unauthorized platforms like 123Movies may violate copyright laws in many countries. Even if you're only viewing and not downloading, your IP address can be tracked by internet service providers (ISPs), government agencies, or copyright enforcers.
